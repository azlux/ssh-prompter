# üîê ssh-prompter

The source of this project is https://git.azlux.fr/azlux/ssh-prompter, **PR are accepted on the source only**.

This standalone **TUI** relies entirely on your SSH configuration file, without any database. It's a Go rewrite of my previous Python 3 script.

### ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Lists all servers from your `~/.ssh/config`
- üîç Instant search to quickly find hosts
- üìÇ Folder grouping for better organization
- üîó Supports `Include` directives in [ssh_config](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#Include)
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight TUI interface (made with Go)
- üîå Connect to the selected host

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
### Via APT (recommended)
See [http://packages.azlux.fr](http://packages.azlux.fr)

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.azlux.fr/debian/ trixie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azlux.list
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/azlux-archive-keyring.gpg  https://azlux.fr/repo.gpg
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssh-prompter
```

### Manually
You need to install the [Go Language](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Then you can build the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/azlux/ssh-prompter.git
cd ssh-prompter
go build
```

## üõ† Configuration
### Alias
Many people don't like the long command `ssh-prompter` so I recommand to put an alias into your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`.
It's safe to replace the `ssh` command since I don't interfere with ssh if additionnals parameters are used.
```bash
# alias ssh="ssh-prompter"
# or
# alias sshp="ssh-prompter"
```

### Usage
Simply run :
```bash
ssh
```
.... and enjoy the fast interactive prompt (‚ö°) then press Enter to connect to the selected host (üöÄ)!

### SSH config configuration
Everything is here : [Official ssh_config manual](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config)
I don't have a custom config file, neither a database. 

This program parse the standard ssh config file. See [the example](examples/config) for a basic config for ssh

### Folder
SSH-Prompter manage folder.
Host will be group by `Folder` when no search.

Two methods:
- The Host name can be `FolderName/Name`, 
- You can add the ssh config option `Folder FolderName`.
  - In this case you need `IgnoreUnknown Folder`on the TOP of your `.ssh/config` file (to avoid error).

You can use both (but not in the same time for the same Host) !

### Additionnal information
All Host with `*` are ignored.

I consider we don't want to "select" them since it's a wildcard for other hosts

### Why two methods for folder :
I first wanted to have the `/` (slash) method but when you use ProxyJump, ssh don't allow slash into the name.
So the option `Folder` is here to allow having a proxy server into a folder.

### TMUX
If you run the script on a tmux.
The window will be renamed with the Host selected.

It use the command `tmux rename-window xxxxx`
